# Classification-of-MNIST-Dataset

# Introduction:
This code snippet demonstrates a simple deep learning model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model uses a multi-layer perceptron architecture and achieves high accuracy in predicting the class of a given digit image.

# Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Keras library (pip install keras)
NumPy library (pip install numpy)
Matplotlib library (pip install matplotlib)
OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)

# Dataset:
The code uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of labeled images of handwritten digits. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used for training the model, and the test set is used for evaluating its performance.

# How to Use:
Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
Copy and paste the code into a Python file or Jupyter Notebook.
Save the file and run it.
The code will automatically download the MNIST dataset, preprocess the images, train the MLP model, and evaluate its performance on the test set. It also includes an example of predicting the class of a custom digit image.

Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, or preprocessing techniques to improve the accuracy or adapt it to your specific use case.

Note: This code assumes a basic understanding of deep learning concepts and assumes the availability of the MNIST dataset.
